ReLearn works by building a database of words and expressions that you looked up. From that database an entry is randomly selected to you to help you remember them. A more detailed list of features:

- ReLearn recognizes the use of the Google Translate app and the page loads in Chrome or Firefox that happen on wiktionary.com. These entries are registered and used to generate the local DB of words and expressions.
- Currently, only Russian is supported, but adding support for new languages is planned.
- After an initial period and collecting 20 entries, you can request new entries for practice in the app. The app home always start with the next item proposed for practicing.
- The last 20 items looked up or practiced is visible in a scrollable list.
- The items are displayed in cards that hide the contents by default - this way making sure that the words are more ingrained in your memory.
- There are daily notifications with the next item sent at 20:30. Until a new item is requested, the same one is used until you are confident that you can remember it.
- You can delete irrelevant entries.
- You can view entries in their original format (Google Translate or on wiktionary.com) by tapping on cards.
- There is complete dark mode support.
